\chapter{Interface Protocols}
As the system is quite big and has a lot of interfaces, here will be the place to discuss all these. 

Mainly the USB-Interface, SPI-Interface for the ESP32-Communication and CAN-Interface are of interest. But also the secondary I2C and general SPI interfaces will be defined here. 

\section{USB Monitor}
\textbf{\textcolor[HTML]{FF0000}{TBD}}

USB is currently only used to log the CAN traffic of the system, if the debug-option on the display is set. This will be expanded in the future by a complete USB monitor which will have many different capabilities such as sending CAN frames, setting variables inside the Mainboard and basically letting the ModLab be controlled via USB. 

More on this will be a subject for the future tho.
